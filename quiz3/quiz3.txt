This program was extremely simple for me to make and run.

Because I am using Arch linux almost all of my programs
are already compiled from C code to machien code through
my package manager pacman. Pacman also supports
multi threading to compile faster using OpenMP. This means
my computer basically required zero input and zero setup
in order to run.

To do this assignment I opened up nano and wrote the
following:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(){
	#pragma omp parallel
	{
		printf("Hello... Bitches from: %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
	}
	return 0;
}

To compile this program I ran the following command in the
terminal:

gcc -o quiz3.o -fopenmp quiz3.c

The following is the output I get from running quiz3.o:

Hello... Bitches from: 0
Hello... Bitches from: 1
Hello... Bitches from: 3
Hello... Bitches from: 2
